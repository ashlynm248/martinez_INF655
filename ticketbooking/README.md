This is a ticket-booking website, dedicated to allowing users to book tickets to events.

When a user opens the site, they will be brought to the homepage where they are able to look at events, sort them, and search them up.

After a user finds an event they like they can click on "Event Details" and then they are brought to the event details page. Here the user will
find more description on the event and the page will also include a map, so the user knows where the event is at. 

Once the user want to add the event to the cart, they must hit the "Add to Cart" button. Here the event will be added. 

The user cannot access the cart or profile page until they are logged in. The user can log in from the login page, or sign up. 

Once the login process happens the user can checkout and they will have booked their event.
